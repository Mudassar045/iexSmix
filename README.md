## Closures

A lambda can reference any variable from the outside scope:

![closure](./closure.png)

As long as you hold the reference to my_lambda, the variable outside_var is also accessible. This is also known as closure: by holding a reference to a lambda, you indirectly hold a reference to all variables it uses, even if those variables are from the external scope.

A closure always captures a specific memory location. Rebinding a variable doesnâ€™t affect the previously defined lambda that references the same symbolic name:
